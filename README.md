### **Project Description: "Let's Meet - Chat App"**  

**"Let's Meet"** is a real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Vanilla JavaScript for frontend interactivity. The application allows users to join a chat room and send messages instantly to all connected users.  

### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Real-time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages instantly using **WebSockets (Socket.io)**.  
✅ **Simple UI:** A clean and minimalistic chat interface with a scrolling chat box.  
✅ **Broadcast System:** Messages are broadcasted to all connected users.  
✅ **User Connection Handling:** Logs when a user connects or disconnects.  
✅ **Client-Server Communication:** Uses **Socket.io** to handle communication between the frontend and backend.  

### **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket.io  
- **Server Deployment:** Localhost (port 9000)  

### **How It Works:**  
1. The user loads the chat page (`index.html`), which connects to the server using **Socket.io**.  
2. Messages are sent through the input field and emitted via WebSockets.  
3. The server listens for incoming messages and broadcasts them to all connected users.  
4. Users see new messages appended to the chat window in real-time.
